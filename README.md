Paging is a part of the Android Jetpack and is used to load and display small amounts of data from the remote server. By doing so, it reduces the use of network bandwidth. Some of the advantages of Paging can be:
You will get the content on the page faster
It uses very less memory
It doesnâ€™t load the useless data i.e. only one or two pages can be loaded at a time.
You can use Paging along with LiveData and ViewModel to observe and update data in an easier way.

**Why use Paging?**
Assume you have more than 1000 items for your list that you are fetching from a backend server. Here are the cons if you are fetching everything at once.
